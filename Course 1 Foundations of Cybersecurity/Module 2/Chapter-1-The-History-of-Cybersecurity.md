# 🕰️ Module 2 – Chapter 1: The History of Cybersecurity

## 🎯 Overview
This chapter explores the evolution of cybersecurity by tracing key incidents, viruses, and malware that shaped the field. It explains how earlier cyber threats influenced modern security practices and how social engineering and digital attacks have evolved over time.

## 🧨 Early Cyber Attacks (1980s–1990s)

### 🔬 The Brain Virus (1986)
- Created by the Alvi brothers to prevent software piracy.
- Spread via infected floppy disks, affecting any computer where the disk was inserted.
- Not intended to destroy data but slowed down systems and disrupted productivity.
- First virus to spread globally, revealing a need for security strategies.

**Impact:** Highlighted the need for preventative security planning.

### 🐛 The Morris Worm (1988)
- Developed by Robert Morris to measure the size of the internet.
- The worm reinfected computers repeatedly, causing crashes due to memory overload.
- Affected 10% of the internet at the time (~6,000 systems).
- **Financial cost:** Millions in damage and remediation.

**Result:** Led to the formation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs).

## 🌐 Digital Age Attacks (2000s–Present)

### 💌 LoveLetter Virus / ILOVEYOU (2000)
- Created by Onel De Guzman to steal login credentials.
- Spread via email with the subject line: “I Love You” and an attachment labeled “Love Letter For You.”
- The virus self-replicated by emailing itself to all contacts.
- Infected 45 million computers and caused $10+ billion in damage.

**Significance:** First major case of social engineering — exploited human emotion and curiosity.

## 🧠 What is Social Engineering?
A manipulation technique that exploits human error to gain unauthorized access or information.

**Types of social engineering include:**
- Phishing (emails)
- Vishing (voice)
- Smishing (SMS)
- Whaling (targeting executives)
- Watering hole attacks
- USB baiting
- Social media phishing
- Physical impersonation

## 🔓 Equifax Breach (2017)
- Attackers exploited multiple known vulnerabilities in Equifax systems.
- Exposed 143 million+ personal records:
  - Social Security Numbers
  - Birth dates
  - Driver’s license numbers
  - Addresses
  - Credit card information

**Impact:**
- Cost Equifax $575 million in settlement fines.
- Served as a wake-up call to many organizations on the importance of proactive security measures.
