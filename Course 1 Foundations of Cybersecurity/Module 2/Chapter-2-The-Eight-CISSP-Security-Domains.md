# üß≠ Module 2 ‚Äì Chapter 2: The Eight CISSP Security Domains

## üìò Overview
The CISSP (Certified Information Systems Security Professional) framework organizes core security concepts into eight domains. These domains guide the work of cybersecurity professionals and help structure both security teams and individual responsibilities.

**Understanding these domains:**
- Helps clarify career paths.
- Highlights interdependencies (a gap in one domain can affect all others).
- Aids in interview preparation and real-world security operations.

## üîí The 8 CISSP Security Domains (2022)

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Security and Risk Management
**Focus:** Defines security goals, mitigates risks, ensures legal/regulatory compliance, and supports business continuity.

**Examples:**
- Updating policies (e.g., HIPAA regulations).
- Creating risk assessments and mitigation plans.

**Associated Attacks:**
- Social engineering
- Supply chain attacks
- Insider threats

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Asset Security
**Focus:** Protecting both digital and physical assets across their lifecycle: storage, retention, and destruction.

**Examples:**
- Secure disposal of old computers and storage media.
- Preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data on retired hardware.

**Associated Attacks:**
- Physical attacks (malicious USBs, card skimming)

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Security Architecture and Engineering
**Focus:** Designing and implementing effective security systems and frameworks.

**Examples:**
- Configuring firewalls
- Implementing secure system architecture

**Associated Attacks:**
- Supply chain attacks
- Exploits targeting system vulnerabilities

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Communication and Network Security
**Focus:** Securing physical and wireless networks and communications.

**Examples:**
- Monitoring network traffic
- Preventing connections to insecure public Wi-Fi
- Drafting secure network policies

**Associated Attacks:**
- Password attacks (brute force, rainbow tables)
- Malware
- Cryptographic attacks

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Identity and Access Management (IAM)
**Focus:** Ensuring only authorized users have access to physical and digital resources.

**Examples:**
- Managing user access and authentication
- Assigning keycard or system access levels

**Associated Attacks:**
- Adversarial AI (used to bypass authentication systems)

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Security Assessment and Testing
**Focus:** Auditing and testing security controls to detect vulnerabilities.

**Examples:**
- Regularly auditing user permissions
- Ensuring payroll access is limited to authorized personnel

**Associated Attacks:**
- Reconnaissance attacks to discover system weaknesses

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Security Operations
**Focus:** Handling incidents, performing forensics, and ensuring system resiliency.

**Examples:**
- Investigating unknown device alerts
- Responding to breaches and executing incident response plans

**Associated Attacks:**
- Supply chain attacks
- Insider breaches
- Physical intrusions

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Software Development Security
**Focus:** Implementing secure coding practices during software creation and updates.

**Examples:**
- Working with development teams to enforce secure password policies
- Protecting user data in mobile apps

**Associated Attacks:**
- Application-layer vulnerabilities
- Insecure APIs or code injection

## üßë‚Äçüíª Understanding Threat Actors

### üéØ What is a Threat Actor?
Any person or group that poses a cybersecurity risk to an organization.

### üß† Types of Threat Actors

| Type                     | Description & Motivation                                     |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) | Skilled attackers, often state-sponsored, with long-term goals |
| Insider Threats          | Employees or contractors misusing legitimate access          |
| Hacktivists              | Politically or socially motivated individuals/groups         |
| Unauthorized Hackers     | Malicious ‚Äúblack hats‚Äù aiming for financial gain or data theft |
| Authorized Hackers       | Ethical hackers hired to test security (white hats)          |
