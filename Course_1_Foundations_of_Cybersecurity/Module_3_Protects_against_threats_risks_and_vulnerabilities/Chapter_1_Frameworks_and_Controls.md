# 📚 Module 3 – Chapter 1: Frameworks and Controls

## 🌱 Security is Like a Garden – The Analogy
Just like gardening needs tools, planning, and ongoing care, cybersecurity requires:

- **Planning and implementing protections**
- **Adapting to evolving threats** (like pests and weather in a garden = hackers and malware in security)
- **Monitoring and updating defenses**

This analogy helps explain why cybersecurity is a continuous and proactive effort.

## 🔐 What Are Frameworks and Controls?

### ✅ Security Framework
A **security framework** is a structured set of guidelines used to:

- Identify and manage risks
- Align security with laws and regulations
- Protect systems and data from threats

---

### 🧩 Four Core Components of a Security Framework
1. **Identify and document security goals**  
   _e.g., Align with GDPR to protect EU citizens' data._

2. **Set guidelines to meet those goals**  
   _e.g., Develop a data request policy for users._

3. **Implement strong security processes**  
   _e.g., Create procedures to update/delete user profiles._

4. **Monitor and communicate results**  
   _e.g., Report GDPR compliance issues to management._

---

## 🛡️ Security Controls
**Security controls** are specific safeguards or actions that reduce risk.

> 📌 Example: Requiring all employees to complete privacy training.

Controls support the implementation of the broader security framework.

## 🔄 The CIA Triad – Core Principles of Security

| Principle       | Meaning                          | Example                                     |
|----------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Confidentiality** | Only authorized users access data | Using strong passwords and access controls  |
| **Integrity**       | Data remains accurate and untampered | Using encryption and checksums              |
| **Availability**    | Data is accessible when needed    | Maintaining system uptime and backups       |

> 💡 Assets = anything of value (e.g., databases, systems). The more valuable, the stronger the required protection.

---

## 🧱 Key Framework: NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- Developed by the U.S. **National Institute of Standards and Technology**
- **Voluntary**, but widely adopted
- Helps manage **short- and long-term risks**
- Includes **standards, best practices, and guidelines**

> 🔎 Example: Analysts use NIST CSF to secure sensitive data from insider threats.

## 🧾 Compliance and Regulations

### 📄 Compliance
The act of following legal and organizational cybersecurity standards.

### 🌍 Important Frameworks, Laws & Regulations

| Name                 | Purpose                                              |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **GDPR (EU)**        | Protects EU citizens’ data rights                    |
| **HIPAA (U.S.)**     | Protects patient health data                         |
| **PCI DSS**          | Secures credit card and payment data                 |
| **FedRAMP**          | Cloud security for U.S. government systems           |
| **CIS Controls**     | Best practices to secure IT systems                  |
| **SOC 1 & SOC 2**    | Audit reports for data safety and access             |
| **NIST CSF & RMF**   | U.S. standards for risk management                   |
| **FERC-NERC**        | Power grid cybersecurity standards                   |
| **ISO Standards**    | International standards for security and processes   |
| **HITRUST**          | Framework for HIPAA compliance                       |
| **Exec Order 14028** | U.S. initiative to enhance national cybersecurity    |

> 📌 Tip: Regulations evolve—cybersecurity professionals must stay informed.

## 🧠 Examples in Practice

- A company handling EU data must notify users within **72 hours** of a breach (**GDPR**).
- A hospital must follow **HIPAA** to protect patient data.
- A financial app processing payments must comply with **PCI DSS**.

## 🧑‍💼 Industry Insight – Heather, VP at Google

> **Handling PII (Personally Identifiable Information) must be:**
> - **Deliberate and regulated**
> - **Stored and processed securely**
> - **Compliant with local laws**

Failing to do so can result in:

- Investigations
- Loss of trust
- Legal actions

> ✅ Always check official sources for updates and seek legal counsel if unsure.

## 📌 Key Takeaways
- **Frameworks** = structured plans to manage cybersecurity risk.
- **Controls** = specific measures to reduce risk and enforce frameworks.
- **CIA Triad** = confidentiality, integrity, availability — the foundation of security.
- **Compliance** = meeting legal obligations like **GDPR**, **HIPAA**, and **PCI DSS**.

Security professionals must **apply frameworks**, **enforce controls**, and **stay legally compliant** to protect users and data.
