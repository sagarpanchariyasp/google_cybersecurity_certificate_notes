# üß≠ Module 3 ‚Äì Chapter 2: Ethics in Cybersecurity

---

## üîê What Are Security Ethics?
**Security ethics** are rules and principles that help cybersecurity professionals make the right decisions when dealing with:

- Sensitive data
- Security incidents
- Access controls

> ‚öñÔ∏è What‚Äôs legal isn‚Äôt always ethical ‚Äî and what‚Äôs ethical isn‚Äôt always easy.

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Real-World Example
Imagine you‚Äôre a security analyst and you discover a serious policy violation by a close friend at work.

**Ethical action**: Report it according to protocol.

**Why?** Because your responsibility is to the **organization and users**, not individual friendships.

## üß± Core Ethical Principles in Cybersecurity

### 1. üîí Confidentiality
Only authorized users should access sensitive data.

- **Ethical rule**: Never share access or data, even with coworkers.
- **Example**: Helping a friend access restricted files violates confidentiality and laws.

### 2. üõ°Ô∏è Privacy Protection
Protecting PII (Personally Identifiable Information) and SPII (Sensitive Personal Information) from unauthorized use.

- **Example**: Don‚Äôt share employee info via unsecured channels, even at your boss's request.

### 3. üìú Laws
Rules enforced by governments to regulate digital behavior.

- **Example**: Leaving patient data exposed violates **HIPAA** ‚Äî it's both illegal and unethical.

## üö´ Counterattacks: Why They're Problematic

### ‚öñÔ∏è U.S. Law
- **CFAA (Computer Fraud and Abuse Act)** bans counterattacks
- Counterattacks = **vigilantism**
- Can cause escalation or international conflict

### üåê International Law
- **ICJ (International Court of Justice)** allows counterattacks **only if**:
  - Non-escalatory
  - Reversible
  - Only affect the original attacker

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Reality: These are nearly impossible to guarantee, so counterattacks are discouraged globally.
